# Predicting the Particle Size Distribution of AgNPs using PBM-CFD Simulations (AgNPs_PSD)

This project focuses on providing a numerical framework based on coupled PBM-CFD simulations to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in both microchannels and well-mixed batch reactors. More information can be found in our publication in Chemical Engineering Journal:

J., 474, p.145692. **[DOI: 10.1016/j.cej.2023.145692](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894723044236)**

Our framework is based on an extension of the traditional Finke-Watzky model, which predicts the temporal evolution of reagents consumption and PSD in well-mixed reactors where the spatial component is not taken into account.
