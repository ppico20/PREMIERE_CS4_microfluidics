# Modeling the Particle Size Distribution of AgNPs in Continuous-Flow Microchannels and Batch Reactors with PBM-CFD

This project focuses on providing a numerical framework based on coupled PBM-CFD simulations to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in both microchannels and well-mixed batch reactors.
