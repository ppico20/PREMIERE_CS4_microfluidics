# AgNPs_PSD: Predicting the Particle Size Distribution of AgNPs using PBM-CFD Simulations

## Overview
This project focuses on providing a numerical framework based on coupled PBM-CFD simulations to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in both microchannels and well-mixed batch reactors. The solvers and libraries are based on **[OpenQBMM](https://github.com/OpenQBMM/OpenQBMM)**, an OpenFoam-based implementation of the **[Quadrature Method of Moments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250917306590?via%3Dihub)**.

## Background

Our framework is based on an extension of the classic **[Finke-Watzky two-step mechanism](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja9705102)** (FW), which predicts the temporal evolution of reagent consumption and PSD in batch reactors for reduction-based synthesis of metal nanoparticles. This model was originally designed for well-mixed systems in which effects related to transport phenomena in a reactor (i.e., reactants mixing) are not taken into account. Given the critical importance of mixing effects in microreactors, we propose a few modifications to the FW mechanism. A summary of these modifications is as follows:

- Addition of an elementary reduction reaction of the form $SN + \nu_{R}R \xrightarrow{k_{r}} Ag_{(l)}$, where $SN$ denotes the silver precursor, $R$ a generic reducing agent, $Ag_{(l)}$ silver atoms in liquid, and $k_{r}$ is the kinetic constant associated with this reduction reaction. 

- Addition of reactive convection-diffusion equations of the form $\frac{\partial (\rho y_{j})}{\partial t} + \nabla_{\textbf{x}}\cdot(\rho \textbf{u}y_{j}) = \nabla_{\textbf{x}}\cdot(D_{j}\nabla_{\textbf{x}}(\rho y_{j})) + S_{j}$ for species $i$. These equations determine the concentration of each species in the system, which are connected to PBM througb models of nucleation and growth.
  
- Inclusion of size-dependent particle diffusion, convection, and agglomeration in the population balance equation.
